In order to use these smoothly, you'll need to have installed the packages [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), [glue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/index.html), and [feather](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feather/index.html), all of which are on CRAN.

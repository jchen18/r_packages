# Making R Packages
This repo contains all the materials for my training on building your own R packages.

If you'd like to use my scripts to follow along during the training in person, just clone or download this repo and you'll be all set.

### Slides  

The slides are in this repo in PDF form. Feel free to use them to follow along!

### Dependencies  

In order to follow along smoothly using my scripts, you'll need to have installed the packages [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html), [glue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/index.html), and [feather](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feather/index.html), all of which are on CRAN.
